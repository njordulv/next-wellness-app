          mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by
          online service providers to facilitate and help to make the
          interaction between users and websites faster and easier, as well as
          to provide reporting information.
        </p>

        <p>
          Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Next Wellness App) are
          called &quot;first party cookies&quot;. Cookies set by parties other
          than the website owner are called &quot;third party cookies&quot;.
          Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be

          We use first party and third party cookies for several reasons. Some
          cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our web
          application to operate, and we refer to these as &quot;essential&quot;
          or &quot;strictly necessary&quot; cookies. Other cookies also enable
          us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the
          experience on our web application. Third parties serve cookies through
          our website for advertising, analytics and other purposes.
